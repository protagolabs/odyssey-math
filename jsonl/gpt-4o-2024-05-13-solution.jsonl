{"Problem_137": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n1. **Distribution of Cards**: We have \\( n \\) cards labeled \\( 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\) distributed among 17 people, with each person receiving at least one card.\n2. **Condition to Satisfy**: There must be at least one person who receives cards with numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that \\( x > y \\) and \\( 118x \\leq 119y \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Condition \\( 118x \\leq 119y \\)\n- Rearrange the inequality: \\( 118x \\leq 119y \\)\n- This can be rewritten as \\( \\frac{x}{y} \\leq \\frac{119}{118} \\approx 1.00847 \\).\n\nThis means that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be close in value, specifically \\( x \\) must be at most about 1.00847 times \\( y \\).\n\n#### Step 2: Minimum Number of Cards per Person\n- Since there are 17 people and each person must receive at least one card, the minimum number of cards \\( n \\) must be at least 17.\n\n#### Step 3: Distributing Cards and Checking the Condition\n- We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that there is always at least one person who receives two cards \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) satisfying \\( 118x \\leq 119y \\).\n\n#### Step 4: Applying the Pigeonhole Principle\n- The Pigeonhole Principle states that if \\( n \\) items are put into \\( m \\) containers, with \\( n > m \\), then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n- Here, we have 17 people (containers) and \\( n \\) cards (items).

{"Problem_333": "To evaluate the integral \\(\\displaystyle{\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\ dx}\\), we will use a combination of techniques including symmetry and residue calculus from complex analysis.\n\n### Detailed Problem Analysis\nThe integral \\(\\displaystyle{\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\ dx}\\) is an improper integral over the interval from 0 to \\(\\infty\\). The integrand \\(\\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\) is a rational function, and we can use complex analysis to evaluate it by considering the integral in the complex plane and using the residue theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Symmetry Consideration\nFirst, note that the integrand is an even function, i.e., \\(\\frac{1}{1+x^4} = \\frac{1}{1+(-x)^4}\\). Therefore, we can write:\n\\[\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\ dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\ dx\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Complex Analysis and Contour Integration\nTo evaluate \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\ dx\\), we extend the integral to the complex plane and consider the integral around a semicircular contour in the upper half-plane.\n\n#### Step 3: Identifying Poles\nThe integrand \\(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}\\) has poles where \\(1+z^4=0\\). Solving \\(z^4 = -1\\), we get the fourth roots of \\(-1\\):\n\\[\nz = e^{i\\pi/4}, e^{3i\\pi/4}, e^{5i\\pi/4}, e^{7i\\pi/4}\n\\]\nThe poles in the upper half-plane are \\(z = e^{i\\pi/4}\\) and \\(z = e^{3i\\pi/4}\\).\n\n#### Step 4: Residue Calculation\nWe calculate the residues at these poles. For a simple pole \\(z_0\\), the residue of \\(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, z_0\\right) = \\lim_{z \\to z_0} (z - z_0) \\frac{1}{1+z^4}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(z = e^{i\\pi/4}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, e^{i\\pi/4}\\right) = \\lim_{z \\to e^{i\\pi/4}} (z - e^{i\\pi/4}) \\frac{1}{1+z^4}\n\\]\nSince \\(1+z^4 = (z - e^{i\\pi/4})(z - e^{3i\\pi/4})(z - e^{5i\\pi/4})(z - e^{7i\\pi/4})\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, e^{i\\pi/4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4e^{i\\pi/4} \\cdot (e^{i\\pi/4} - e^{3i\\pi/4})(e^{i\\pi/4} - e^{5i\\pi/4})(e^{i\\pi/4} - e^{7i\\pi/4})}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for \\(z = e^{3i\\pi/4}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, e^{3i\\pi/4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4e^{3i\\pi/4} \\cdot (e^{3i\\pi/4} - e^{i\\pi/4})(e^{3i\\pi/4} - e^{5i\\pi/4})(e^{3i\\pi/4} - e^{7i\\pi/4})}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Summing the Residues\nThe integral around the contour is \\(2\\pi i\\) times the sum of the residues inside the contour. Therefore:\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\ dx = 2\\pi i \\left( \\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, e^{i\\pi/4}\\right) + \\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, e^{3i\\pi/4}\\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\n#### Step 6: Simplifying the Residues\nAfter simplifying the residues, we find that:\n\\[\n\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, e^{i\\pi/4}\\right) = \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/4}}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, e^{3i\\pi/4}\\right) = \\frac{e^{-3i\\pi/4}}{4}\n\\]\n\nSumming these residues:\n\\[\n\\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, e^{i\\pi/4}\\right) + \\text{Res}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+z^4}, e^{3i\\pi/4}\\right) = \\frac{e^{-i\\pi/4} + e^{-3i\\pi/4}}{4}\n\\]\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we get:\n\\[\ne^{-i\\pi/4} + e^{-3i\\pi/4} = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\right) + \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(-\\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further, we find:\n\\[\ne^{-i\\pi/4} + e^{-3i\\pi/4} = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the integral evaluates to:\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\ dx = 2\\pi i \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result seems incorrect.

{"Problem_365": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the variance of the random variable \\(X\\) given that \\(X > 1\\) and \\(Y > 2\\). This involves several steps, including finding the conditional probability density function (PDF) of \\(X\\) given the conditions, and then using this PDF to compute the variance.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Joint PDF and Marginal PDFs\nThe given joint PDF is:\n\\[ f(x, y) = 6e^{-(2x+3y)}, \\quad x > 0, \\ y > 0. \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the Conditional PDF of \\(X\\) Given \\(X > 1\\) and \\(Y > 2\\)\nTo find the conditional PDF of \\(X\\) given \\(X > 1\\) and \\(Y > 2\\), we need to normalize the joint PDF over the region \\(x > 1\\) and \\(y > 2\\).\n\nFirst, compute the normalization constant \\(C\\):\n\\[ C = \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\int_{2}^{\\infty} 6e^{-(2x+3y)} \\, dy \\, dx. \\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Normalization Constant\nEvaluate the inner integral with respect to \\(y\\):\n\\[ \\int_{2}^{\\infty} 6e^{-(2x+3y)} \\, dy = 6e^{-2x} \\int_{2}^{\\infty} e^{-3y} \\, dy. \\]\n\nThe integral of \\(e^{-3y}\\) from 2 to \\(\\infty\\) is:\n\\[ \\int_{2}^{\\infty} e^{-3y} \\, dy = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-3y}}{-3} \\right]_{2}^{\\infty} = \\frac{e^{-6}}{3}. \\]\n\nSo, the inner integral becomes:\n\\[ \\int_{2}^{\\infty} 6e^{-(2x+3y)} \\, dy = 6e^{-2x} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-6}}{3} = 2e^{-2x}e^{-6} = 2e^{-(2x+6)}. \\]\n\nNow, evaluate the outer integral with respect to \\(x\\):\n\\[ \\int_{1}^{\\infty} 2e^{-(2x+6)} \\, dx = 2e^{-6} \\int_{1}^{\\infty} e^{-2x} \\, dx. \\]\n\nThe integral of \\(e^{-2x}\\) from 1 to \\(\\infty\\) is:\n\\[ \\int_{1}^{\\infty} e^{-2x} \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-2x}}{-2} \\right]_{1}^{\\infty} = \\frac{e^{-2}}{2}. \\]\n\nSo, the normalization constant \\(C\\) is:\n\\[ C = 2e^{-6} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-2}}{2} = e^{-8}. \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Conditional PDF\nThe conditional PDF of \\(X\\) given \\(X > 1\\) and \\(Y > 2\\) is:\n\\[ f_{X|X>1, Y>2}(x) = \\frac{f(x, y)}{C} = \\frac{6e^{-(2x+3y)}}{e^{-8}} = 6e^{8}e^{-(2x+3y)}. \\]\n\nSince we are only interested in \\(X\\), integrate out \\(y\\):\n\\[ f_{X|X>1, Y>2}(x) = \\int_{2}^{\\infty} 6e^{8}e^{-(2x+3y)} \\, dy = 6e^{8}e^{-2x} \\int_{2}^{\\infty} e^{-3y} \\, dy. \\]\n\nWe already computed this integral:\n\\[ \\int_{2}^{\\infty} e^{-3y} \\, dy = \\frac{e^{-6}}{3}. \\]\n\nSo, the conditional PDF simplifies to:\n\\[ f_{X|X>1, Y>2}(x) = 6e^{8}e^{-2x} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-6}}{3} = 2e^{2}e^{-2x} = 2e^{2-2x}, \\quad x > 1. \\]\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Variance of \\(X\\)\nThe variance of \\(X\\) given \\(X > 1\\) and \\(Y > 2\\) is:\n\\[ \\text{Var}(X|X>1, Y>2) = E[X^2|X>1, Y>2] -
